- In air: reduced movement control? (NOT reduced friction)
- Left clicking and pressing w repeatedly gains height (Fixed by just not enabling retracting during firing)
- Right click to detach(?)
- Timer for attaching(?)
- Cut Jumping
- Fix clicking to the right while also attached

Potential Fixes for Movement (add to Debug):
- Move towards hook end while firing
- Jumping while grappled gives insane height
Jumping
 - Hold to charge jump only on rope
 - Disable Jumping
 - Disable Jumping except for on rope
- Shorter rope(?)
- Permanent coyote time until canceled?

- Further polygon drawn around grapple hook to prevent "slipping over" with what should be a solid hook
- There should be a release button, just to let go of momentum
