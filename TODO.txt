- In air: reduced movement control? (NOT reduced friction)
- Modify so sensor can't fire while it's blocked
- Add player velocity to grapple firing
- Player chamfer radius still doesn't stop sudden stops. One stopgap: amalgamate tilemap collision layers into one shape?
- Jump on ground hit (rather than waiting for body to re-appear)
- Check https://labs.phaser.io/edit.html?src=src/tilemap/collision/matter%20platformer%20modify%20map.js for movement ideas
- Cannot jump if colliding with a corner exactly (although it's only if you're moving left into the corner and you're hitting jump.)
- Fix firing mechanic
