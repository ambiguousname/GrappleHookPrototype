- In air: reduced movement control? (NOT reduced friction)
- Modify so sensor can't fire while it's blocked
- Left clicking and pressing w repeatedly gains height

Potential Fixes for Movement (add to Debug):
- Left click to fire rope again instead of cancelling
- Move towards hook end while firing
- Jumping while grappled gives insane height
Jumping
 - Hold to charge jump only on rope
 - Disable Jumping
 - Disable Jumping except for on rope
- Shorter rope(?)
- Permanent coyote time until canceled?
